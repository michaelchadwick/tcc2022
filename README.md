Tiny Code Christmas 2022

[https://tcc.lovebyte.party](https://tcc.lovebyte.party)

I'm planning on doing each day's entry in [PICO-8](https://lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), but I might use [TIC-80](https://tic80.com), as well.

## Day 1: Making Shapes

Create a Christmas scene with simple shapes, like rectangles, circles, and lines.

* RECTFILL()
* LINE()

## Day 2: Snow time() Like the Present

Create animated snow effect.

* _DRAW()

## Day 3 - Little By Little

Create a full-screen effect by changing individual pixels.

* PSET()

## Day 4 - Sines of the Times

Use sin() to create a "plasma" effect.

* SIN()
* % function to create "cycles" of numbers

## Day 5 - Polar Express

Create an animated tunnel effect using polar coordinates.

* atan2()
* sqrt()
